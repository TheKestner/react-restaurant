# Restaurant App
## Main Goal:
You've been asked to design a menu website for a new restaurant opening at 348 E Main St, Lexington, KY. The owners are busy working on their recipes and haven't picked a name yet, so they've asked you to suggest one and use it in your design.
The owners are still working on their recipes. They've populated an API with many possible choices. You are to use the API to generate a sample menu to add to your website. The API URL is: https://sheltered-refuge-85246.herokuapp.com/api/json

A single-page web app that serves as a restaurant splash page with a menu.
